# Prompt
Based on the needs of this project, generate sample test data based on the following personas:

## Persona 1
Persona for Content-Based Filtering: Maria, the Project Researcher

* Grade Level: 6th Grade

* Reading Habits & Scenario: Maria is working on a history project about the solar system. She is a focused student who, for this specific task, needs to find several books on a single topic. Her goal is to gather as much information as she can about planets, stars, and space exploration.

* Goals: Maria needs the recommendation system to act like a research assistant, helping her quickly find all the relevant books on her specific topic available in the library.

### Sample Library Rental History for Maria:

* "The Planets" by Gail Gibbons

* "A Hundred Billion Trillion Stars" by Seth Fishman

* "Margaret and the Moon" by Dean Robbins (A picture book biography of Margaret Hamilton, a lead Apollo engineer)

### How to Use Maria to Demonstrate Content-Based Filtering:

This persona is perfect for showcasing the core strengths of content-based filtering. The recommendation process is direct and easy to explain.

* Feature Extraction: You can explain that the system begins by creating an embedding for every book based on its content features: title, description, and genre. For Maria's books, key features would include "planets," "stars," "space," "NASA," "astronomy," and "non-fiction."

* User Profile: The system then analyzes the features of the books Maria has recently borrowed to understand her current, specific interest.

* Recommendation via Similarity: The system then recommends other books from the catalog that are most similar based on those features. It would find other books with a high density of keywords like "solar system," "astronauts," and "galaxies."

## Persona 2
Persona for Collaborative Filtering: Alex, The Genre Explorer

* Grade Level: 7th Grade

* Reading Habits & Scenario: Alex is a voracious reader who has explored the fantasy genre deeply. He's read most of the popular fantasy series available in the school library and is looking for his next great adventure. While he loves fantasy, he is open to discovering new genres that might give him the same sense of wonder and world-building he enjoys.

* Goals: Alex wants to find books that will surprise him. He is looking for recommendations that go beyond the obvious fantasy sequels or similar series and introduce him to new authors and even new genres he might not have considered on his own.

### Sample Library Rental History for Alex:

* "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" by J.K. Rowling

* "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien

* "Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief" by Rick Riordan

* "Eragon" by Christopher Paolini

* "The Golden Compass" by Philip Pullman

* "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" by C.S. Lewis

### How to Use Alex to Demonstrate Collaborative Filtering:

Alex is the ideal persona to demonstrate the "omniscient discovery" power of collaborative filtering. His well-defined taste provides a strong starting point to showcase how the model can facilitate serendipitous discoveries.

* Identify Similar Users: The system analyzes the book borrowing history of all students. It identifies a group of "similar users"â€”other students who also borrowed and presumably enjoyed many of the same fantasy books as Alex.

* Analyze Similar Users' Broader Tastes: The model then looks at what else these similar users have read and enjoyed. It may discover that a significant number of these fantasy fans also borrowed and liked a specific set of science fiction books, like "The Giver" by Lois Lowry or the "Ender's Game" series.

* Generate Serendipitous Recommendations: Because similar users are interested in that item, the model can recommend these science fiction books to Alex, even though he has never shown a direct interest in the sci-fi genre himself.
